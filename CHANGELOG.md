# Changelog

All notable changes to page-assistant. This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## 0.4.0 — Production hardening

A hardening release across security, reliability, UX, accessibility, and distribution,
plus two new capabilities. All packages bumped `0.3.0 → 0.4.0` together.

### New features

- **Server-capability–aware voice settings.** The extended settings modal fetches
  `GET /v1/voice/capabilities` and greys out server TTS/STT (ElevenLabs · OpenAI ·
  Whisper) the server has no key for, so users can't pick a voice that silently falls
  back to the browser. Degrades gracefully to browser-only if the endpoint is missing.
- **CLI `serve --config` + runnable full-server example.** `page-assistant serve` can
  now load a config module/JSON to mount `/v1/agent`, `/llm.txt`, and
  `/.well-known/llm-actions.json`. New `examples/full-server.mjs` starts a
  capability-backed server so the agent-to-agent journey works out of the box.

### UX & accessibility

- Fixed the extended settings modal not revealing the Provider/Voice rows when
  switching the speech engine to Server TTS — it now re-renders on both the assistant
  and voice settings change events instead of requiring a modal reopen.
- Added a note that models depend on the server's configured providers; an unsupported
  model errors at send time rather than failing silently.

### Reliability

- CLI `serve` now loads a local `.env` and persists feedback tickets to disk
  (`JsonFileTicketStore`), matching the server bin instead of losing tickets on restart.
- CLI `chat` and the MCP `ask_page_assistant` tool now return a clear message when
  `/v1/agent` is not mounted (404) instead of an opaque error.
- CLI and MCP report their real version from `package.json` instead of a hardcoded
  literal.

### Security

- Documented the dual capability-registration model (browser vs server) so integrators
  don't assume widget capabilities reach `/v1/agent`.
- Hardening guidance carried forward in SECURITY.md (auth on spend endpoints, confirm
  gates, rate limits, CORS).

### Distribution

- Added `prepublishOnly: npm run build` to core/widget/server/cli/mcp so the gitignored
  `dist/` is always built before publish.
- Added `repository` (with `directory`) to the CLI and MCP packages.
- Honest README quick start: clone → `npm install && npm run build` → open
  `examples/demo.html`; unpkg/npm paths clearly marked as post-publish.
- Per-package READMEs for core/widget/server/cli/mcp (the npm package pages) and a
  Python client README.
- Added cli + mcp to the README packages table; documented the MCP server in AGENTS.md.
- CI adds a typecheck step; new `release.yml` builds and publishes on a version tag.
- Removed the empty `examples/greenpert` directory and stray `.DS_Store`.

## 0.3.0

Production-ready baseline: chat history, distribution scaffolding, security hardening,
voice fixes, live memory, blind-mode actions.
